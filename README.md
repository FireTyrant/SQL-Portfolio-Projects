# SQL-Portfolio-Projects

🗄️ SQL Learning Journey by Jess McGill
Welcome to my SQL Learning Journey! This repository is a collection of projects that document my progress as I explore SQL, databases, and data analysis. My goal is to continuously improve my skills, apply what I’ve learned to real-world datasets, and showcase my growth.

📌 About Me
I’m a data enthusiast with a background in data analytics, process improvement, and reporting. As I work towards mastering SQL, I’m applying structured query techniques to clean, analyze, and optimize data for meaningful insights.

📂 My SQL Journey
This repository is a work in progress, evolving as I learn and apply new concepts. Some of the areas I’m currently exploring include:

📊 Data Cleaning & Transformation – Learning how to standardize messy datasets using JOINs, CTEs, CASE statements, and other SQL functions.

📈 Data Analysis & Reporting – Writing queries to extract insights, summarize data, and build reports.

⚡ Query Optimization – Understanding indexing, partitioning, and execution plans to improve performance.

📡 Database Design – Practicing normalization, ERD modeling, and relational database concepts.

🔧 Tools & Technologies

SQL Databases: MySQL | PostgreSQL | SQL Server | BigQuery

Data Visualization: Power BI | Tableau

Other: Python (for automation) | GitHub | Google Cloud
